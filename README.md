Project 2 Technigo 2021 - create a News site

## The problem

Being the first solo project in the education several issues occurred but also solved. 

Flexbox layout - understanding how a parent and child work in relation to each other. By using the development tool frequent I discovered that creating a new class sometimes was necessary to be able to align the content the way I wanted.

Images - not behaving as expected and resizing issues. 
With the help from lecture and searching Stackoverflow and other related sites understanding how to make proper adjustments. 

@media queries - how to not repeat code. 
Once understanding that the site should be created with a mobile first approach it was easier to also create fewer lines of code and avoid repeating.
